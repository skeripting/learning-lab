    In the past, I have used verbatim SQL queries. As part of a spike for my internship at Cogbias, I
    am learning sequelize.

    Sequelize is an ORM (object relational mapper). This basically means that sequelize allows you to 
    turn relational database queries (raw SQL) into objects (JSON)!.

    This is pretty cool, because now, you don't need to remember all the SQL queries. You can just treat
    them all like objects (similar to mongo db).

    This is my first time using sequelize, and I'm excited.

    Learnings: npm is Node Package Manager.

    npx is Node Package eXecute, which allows you to execute packages without installing them globally.
    It basically allows you to run a one time command without installing it on your computer.
    
    To initialize sequelize, I had to use npx sequelize-cli init.
